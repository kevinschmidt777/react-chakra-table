# React Chakra Table

A simple, sortable, filterable, react table grid - styled with the ChakraUI library.
It is build with typescript and able to use sorting and filtering out of the box for each column needed.

## Requirements

The following libraries have to be installed already inside of your project:

- react (18.0.0 or higher)
- react-dom (18.0.0 or higher)
- @chakra-ui/react (2.0.0 or higher)
- @emotion/react (11.0.0 or higher)
- @emotion/styled (11.0.0 or higher)
- framer-motion (6.0.0 or higher)

Bottomline, those dependencies should be installed already anyway, if you are creating a modern react app with ChakraUI.

## Dependencies

React-chakra-table depends on some other libraries to work propably. The following dependencies will be installed autoatically, if not there already:

- @chakra-ui/icons
- @tanstack/react-table
- dayjs
- react-export-table-to-excel
